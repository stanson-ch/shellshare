This is simple Share Plugin.

Plugin just run shell script ( /home/user/.local/share/scripts/share.sh by default )
with file full path as first argument for each file when user choose "User Script" 
sharing option.

Example script created by debian/postinst during installation has to be edited
for your needs. By default it is just scp to some location.

Have fun!
